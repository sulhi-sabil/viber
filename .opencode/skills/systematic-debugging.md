# Skill: Systematic Debugging

Source: obra-superpowers-systematic-debugging (via SkillHub)

4-phase root cause analysis and debugging methodology.

## Commands

- Phase 1: Observation - Gather data about the issue
- Phase 2: Hypothesis - Form theories about root cause
- Phase 3: Isolation - Narrow down the problem area
- Phase 4: Resolution - Fix and verify

## The 4-Phase Process

### Phase 1: Observation
- Reproduce the issue consistently
- Gather all error messages and logs
- Identify when it started happening
- Document the exact conditions

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Formation
- List all possible causes
- Rank by probability
- Consider recent changes
- Check for similar issues

### Phase 3: Isolation
- Binary search through code/commits
- Create minimal test case
- Remove variables one by one
- Pinpoint exact failure point

### Phase 4: Resolution
- Implement fix
- Test thoroughly
- Check for side effects
- Document the solution

## Debugging Techniques

- Root-cause tracing
- Defense in depth
- Condition-based waiting
- Verification before completion
