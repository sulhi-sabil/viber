Source: proffesor-for-testing-agentic-qe-skill-builder (via SkillHub)

Quality engineering and testing automation for agentic systems.

## Commands

- Design test strategy: Create comprehensive test plans
- Generate test cases: Write automated test cases
- Execute tests: Run test suites and analyze results
- Quality gates: Implement automated quality checks

## Testing Pyramid

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual functions/components
   - Fast and isolated
   - High coverage

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test component interactions
   - Verify integrations work
   - Medium speed

3. **E2E Tests**
   - Test complete workflows
   - User perspective testing
   - Slower but comprehensive

## Agentic Testing Principles

- Test agent decision-making logic
- Verify tool usage patterns
- Check context management
- Validate output quality
- Monitor performance metrics

## Test Categories

- **Functional**: Does it work correctly?
- **Performance**: Is it fast enough?
- **Reliability**: Does it handle errors gracefully?
- **Security**: Are there vulnerabilities?
- **Usability**: Is the output useful?
