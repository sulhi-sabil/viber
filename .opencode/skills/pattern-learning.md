# Skill: Pattern Learning

Extract patterns from successful and failed operations to improve future performance.

## Commands

- Analyze successes: Review successful operations for reusable patterns
- Analyze failures: Review failed operations to identify anti-patterns
- Build pattern library: Document discovered patterns
- Update heuristics: Refine decision-making based on learned patterns

## Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Record operation inputs and outputs
   - Track success/failure outcomes
   - Measure performance metrics

2. **Pattern Extraction**
   - Identify common successful approaches
   - Flag recurring failure modes
   - Detect correlations between inputs and outcomes

3. **Knowledge Integration**
   - Update internal pattern library
   - Refine agent behavior heuristics
   - Share patterns with other agents

## Pattern Categories

- **Success Patterns**: Approaches that consistently work
- **Anti-Patterns**: Approaches that consistently fail
- **Contextual Patterns**: Approaches that work in specific contexts
- **Optimization Patterns**: Ways to improve efficiency
