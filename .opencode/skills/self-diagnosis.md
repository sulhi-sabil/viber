# Skill: Self-Diagnosis

Analyze agent performance and system health to identify issues and improvement opportunities.

## Commands

- Check agent logs: Review recent operation logs for errors or warnings
- Performance metrics: Measure task completion times and success rates
- Health check: Verify all components are functioning correctly
- Error pattern analysis: Identify recurring error patterns

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Agent response times are within acceptable limits
- [ ] No unhandled exceptions in recent operations
- [ ] Memory usage is stable
- [ ] All integrations are responding
- [ ] Knowledge base is up to date
- [ ] No circular dependencies detected

## Patterns to Detect

1. **Performance Degradation**
   - Increasing response times
   - Memory leaks
   - Resource exhaustion

2. **Logic Errors**
   - Inconsistent state
   - Race conditions
   - Edge case failures

3. **Integration Issues**
   - API timeouts
   - Authentication failures
   - Service unavailability
