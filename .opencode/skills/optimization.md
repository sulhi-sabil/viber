# Skill: Optimization

Maximize efficiency and effectiveness of operations.

## Commands

- Performance profiling: Identify bottlenecks
- Resource optimization: Minimize resource usage
- Algorithm improvement: Use more efficient algorithms
- Caching strategy: Implement intelligent caching

## Optimization Dimensions

1. **Time Efficiency**
   - Reduce execution time
   - Minimize latency
   - Parallelize where possible

2. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Minimize memory usage
   - Reduce CPU consumption
   - Optimize storage

3. **Cost Efficiency**
   - Reduce API calls
   - Minimize token usage
   - Optimize model selection

4. **Quality Efficiency**
   - Reduce error rates
   - Minimize rework
   - Improve first-time success

## Optimization Anti-Patterns

- Premature optimization
- Over-optimization at expense of readability
- Optimizing without measuring
- Ignoring maintenance cost
